          <p>
            The world of technology has progressed emensly in the 31 years since I was born </p>
          <p>
            The earliest I can remember being emotionally invested in computers was when I was a child, elementary age. I would sit at home for hours playing a math game, whith an adventurist that was climbing a mountain. My parents installed it on our home computer, and I was one of very few people I knew who owned a home office. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Now as an adult, I find myself wanting a mentally fulfilling career,the type of career that people say, "will never feel like a day of work if you enjoy what you do!" To me, that career is computer coding!
          </p>
          <p> 
            In downtown San Antonio, where I am from, they are building beautiful new buisnesses with building as tall as the sky. Every time I see a new building go up, I think about how many jobs that building will hold and how many dreams will come true inside those walls.
            I believe it would be wonderful to wake up every morning and work for a prestige company, how great it would be to fulfill a promise to a employer who relies on me, and to be able to work along side my co-workers who are the same driven person that I am.
          </p>
           <p>
             In the next two years, I will have graduated from an amazing school, and would love to work for a reputable company, steady increase the knowlage of my trade and help evolve the world we live in. 
            </p>
          <p> 
            I believe, a career in computer coding would be mutually beneficial for the company I work for, because I hold a lot of integrity in my worklife and personal. My problem solving and communication skills are substansial. In fact, solving a problem with someone brings a sort of joy to me, and creates a bond between the group that is working together!</p>
